**CSSSCL** is a python package that uses Combined Sequence Similarity Scores for accurate taxonomic CLassification of long and short reads.

Downloading and using cssscl is free, if you use cssscl or its code in your work 
please acknowledge cssscl by citing Borozan I, Watt S, Ferretti V. "Integrating 
alignment-based and alignment-free sequence similarity measures for biological sequence classification."

This is important for us since obtaining grants is one significant way to fund planning 
and implementation for our project. Also if you find cssscl useful in your research feel 
free to let us know.
